        <p>Kia ora! My name is Jack</p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m a Vancouver Island born, Waiheke Island grown grad from Dev
          Academy Aotearoa
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking for my first opportunity working in the tech industry and to
          put my new skills as a full-stack software developer to the test!
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to learn as much as possible about coding, and hope to pick up
          heaps of new skills from collaborative team based project work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dev Academy has taught me a fullstack base of React.js, TypeScript,
          SQLite (Knex), Express, Superagent & Supertest.
          <br></br> I want to upskill myself and learn C, C#, Node.js, Java,
          Python, and .NET core.
          <p>
            Currently during my job search I am working on a personal project to
            inspire ideas from future Dev Academy students with their Friday
            Projects, The Idea Fusioner (WEBAPP).
            <br></br> I am also studying CS50x from Harvard and Understanding
            Node.js.
