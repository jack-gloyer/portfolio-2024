      <h1>More About the Dev</h1>
      <p>I&#39;m Jack, a fresh grad from Dev Academy Aotearoa.</p>
      <p>
        Over 15 weeks, I developed my skills with React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS,
        SQLite, Express, Superagent, Supertest and Tailwind.
        <br></br>I also went in depth with soft skills like corageous
        conversations, nonviolent communication, giving and receiving feedback,
        reflection and active listening. <br></br>Dev also simulated a
        collaborative working environment closely by teaching pair programming
        and Agile methodologies in their curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
        After being part of the team that won Best Bar Food in Australia 2023, I
        chose to return home and begin looking for a career change.
        <br></br> Since high school I always wanted to begin a career in tech,
        and this felt like the right time to make the jump.
        <br></br> I bring a strong background from my previous career in working
        in collaborative, productive teams.
        <br></br> My communication skills are my strong point, and I excel at
        team-based productions.
