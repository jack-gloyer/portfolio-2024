      <h1>More About the Dev</h1>
      <p>I&#39;m Jack, a fresh grad from Dev Academy Aotearoa.</p>
      <p>
        Over 17 weeks, I developed my skills with React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS,
        SQLite, Express, Superagent, Supertest and Tailwind.
        <br></br>I also went in depth with soft skills like corageous
        conversations, nonviolent communication, giving and receiving feedback,
        reflection and active listening. <br></br>Dev also simulated a
        collaborative working environment closely by teaching pair programming
        and Agile methodologies in their curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting into web development has been a goal of mine for a long time.
